# Learn Lua in an Hour

## Part 1

Hey everybody - this is Tyler. I'm going to try to teach you Lua in about an hour.

I previously wrote a post called
[Learn Lua in 15 Minutes](http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/).
That title is link bait, I admit.
The purpose of that post is to give you a quick reference or a quick introduction
to the language.

When I learn a language, I like to
pick a relatively simple project and dive into the language using
quick references to get started,
but that does not give you mastery of a language.
This video is meant as a next step after getting a taste of the language.
This video is a big step along the path toward really understanding what
Lua is about.

What I'm going to do is take a lot of the material from
[this book](http://www.lua.org/pil/)
and present it in a video format.
I plan to turn this into the first part in a series of videos.
This video will focus on what I call the *core* of the language.
The core of the langauge includes things like the keywords, the syntax,
and all of the major built-in functions.

I'll talk about a design pattern for object-oriented work.
It's a fundamental pattern in Lua.

Essentially, what I'll try to convey in this one video is
most of the language.
90% of what you'll do if you're programming Lua will be here.

The next video will cover the standard library.
That's the biggest piece I don't plan to cover right now, although
I will talk about the most common functions that you'll want to use
from the standard library.

The language of Lua itself is at around version 5.1 or 5.2.
The official version right now is 5.2.
LuaJIT is another implementation that uses a just-in-time compiler
which is currently at version 5.1.
Lua 5.3 will come out soonish - I don't know exactly when.

I think the material in this video will be relevant for many years because
Lua tends to change slowly and carefully.
The language designers are deliberate with their changes.

So let's get started!
