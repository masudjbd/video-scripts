<p>Hi - I'm Tyler.</p>
<p>In this video, I'm going to cover the Lua programming language in about one
hour.</p>
<p>I previously wrote a post called
<a href="http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/">Learn Lua in 15 Minutes</a>.
That post is
basically a quick reference that you can use to get started - a very
shallow understanding of the language. Or to refresh your memory if you
already know it.</p>
<p>The idea of <em>this</em> video is to take another step toward mastering the
language of Lua.
I'm going to be covering all of what I consider to be the core of the
language, which isn't 100% of everything that you can do with Lua, but it
does cover most of what you'll use day-to-day.</p>
<p>Lua is currently at version 5.3. I will cover versions 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3.
Which is pretty easy because they're all basically the same. I just have
to highlight the small number of differences between those versions.</p>
<p>You might care about older versions of Lua because some C apps will have
an older version of Lua embedded in them. Or if you're using LuaJIT, which
is the Lua just-in-time compiler, then you are going to be using version
5.1. At least at the time I'm making this video, that's true.</p>
<p>This is the first in what I envision as being a series of Lua
videos/tutorials covering more and more advanced topics in Lua.
You don't have to watch the rest. If you just want to know how to program
in Lua, this is the only video you need to watch.</p>
<p>I can imagine future videos covering the standard library or the C API.
Basically, the topics in
<a href="http://www.lua.org/pil/">this book</a> (Programming in Lua). This is the
official Lua book.</p>
<p>Let's dive into the language - let's get started!</p><a href="part02.html" style="float:right">Next</a>
