<!-- 11.1 io intro -->

<p>So far we know how to print to standard out using the <code>print</code> function.</p>
<p>Now I'm going to talk about two functions in the standard library called
<code>io.read</code> and <code>io.write</code>.
<code>io</code> is a table.
It's a table that has some functions as some of its values.</p>
<p>It's part of the standard library, and
if you're using Lua from an embedded app, such as a game, the
developers may have chosen to exclude some of the modules of the
modules of the standard library - or all of them -
for security reasons, probably.
So it's not guaranteed that you have access to these functions.
By default, such as in the interpreter, you <em>do</em> have access to these functions.</p>
<p>I'm going to tell you about them since they're very useful.</p>
<!-- 11.2 io.read -->

<p>The default action of <code>io.read</code> is to read a line from standard in.</p>
<p>The return value is the string with the line.
However, it excludes the newline character at the end of the line.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; line = io.read()
hi  -- Editor's note: the string "hi&lt;enter&gt;" is user-typed.
&gt; = line
hi
&gt; = #line
2
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use <code>io.read</code> by giving it a number parameter.
This asks <code>io.read</code> to read up to that many characters from standard in.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; s = io.read(4)
abcdefghi  -- User-typed.
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see in this example,
the variable <code>s</code> will have 4 characters.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; = s
abcd
</code></pre>
<!-- 11.3 io.write -->

<p><code>io.write</code> acts similarly to <code>print</code>.
I'll give it a string as input here:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; s = 'hallo\n'
&gt; io.write(s)
hallo
</code></pre>
<p>One thing that's interesting is that the string contained a
newline. <code>io.write</code> did <em>not</em> add a newline - that's the way
<code>io.write</code> behaves.
<code>print</code>, on the other hand, if I give it the same string, <em>will</em>
add a newline:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; print(s)
hallo!

&gt;  -- Editor's note: the next Lua prompt is here.
</code></pre>
<p><code>io.write</code> also accepts multiple parameters.
If it takes a number as an input, then it converts that to a string;
otherwise it only accepts strings.
It concatenates multiple parameters together without any spaces
between them, and never adds a newline at the end, like that:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; io.write('pi is ', 'close to ', 3.14)
pi is close to 3.14&gt;  -- Editor's note: the &gt; is Lua's input prompt.
</code></pre>      </section>
